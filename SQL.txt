	******    Data Types    *******

Data types specify the type of data for a particular column.

If a column called "LastName" is going to hold names, then that particular column should have a "varchar" (variable-length character) data type.

The most common data types:
Numeric
INT -A normal-sized integer that can be signed or unsigned.
FLOAT(M,D) - A floating-point number that cannot be unsigned. You can optionally define the display length (M) and the number of decimals (D).
DOUBLE(M,D) - A double precision floating-point number that cannot be unsigned. You can optionally define the display length (M) and the number of decimals (D). 

Date and Time
DATE - A date in YYYY-MM-DD format.
DATETIME - A date and time combination in YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS format.
TIMESTAMP - A timestamp, calculated from midnight, January 1, 1970
TIME - Stores the time in HH:MM:SS format.

String Type
CHAR(M) - Fixed-length character string. Size is specified in parenthesis. Max 255 bytes.
VARCHAR(M) - Variable-length character string. Max size is specified in parenthesis.
BLOB - "Binary Large Objects" and are used to store large amounts of binary data, such as images or other types of files. 
TEXT - Large amount of text data.



     ******      SQL Constraints     **********
 
SQL constraints are used to specify rules for table data.

The following are commonly used SQL constraints:
NOT NULL - Indicates that a column cannot contain any NULL value.
UNIQUE - Does not allow to insert a duplicate value in a column. The UNIQUE constraint maintains the uniqueness of a column in a table. More than one UNIQUE column can be used in a table.
PRIMARY KEY - Enforces the table to accept unique data for a specific column and this constraint create a unique index for accessing the table faster.
CHECK - Determines whether the value is valid or not from a logical expression.
DEFAULT - While inserting data into a table, if no value is supplied to a column, then the column gets the value set as DEFAULT.
